# Intelligent-Tutoring-System-with-Natural-Language-Processing-and-Deep-Learning

#### Overview
The objective of this project is to develop an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning to provide personalized and interactive learning experiences for students. This system will analyze students' interactions and responses in real-time, offer instant feedback, and adapt the learning material according to their needs.

#### Project Goals
###### Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and preprocess educational content and student interaction data.
###### Natural Language Processing: Implement NLP techniques to understand and respond to students' queries.
###### Deep Learning Models: Develop deep learning models for personalized learning path recommendations.
###### Interactive Interface: Create an engaging and interactive web interface for students.
###### Deployment: Ensure scalable deployment using modern containerization and orchestration tools.

#### System Architecture
###### Data Collection: Collect data from various educational sources and platforms.
###### Data Storage: Use a combination of relational and NoSQL databases for efficient data storage.
###### NLP Processing: Utilize advanced NLP techniques to understand and generate educational content.
###### Deep Learning: Train deep learning models for personalized learning and feedback.
###### User Interface: Develop a responsive and interactive UI using modern web technologies.
###### Deployment: Deploy the application using Docker and Kubernetes.
